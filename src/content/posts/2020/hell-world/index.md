As we buckle up and head into 2021, I took the time to prepare a new place to write my thoughts.
The opening theme will be a typo, which I hope is to be the first of many.

As it usually goes, a new year comes with _new years resolutions_.
And here are mine:

Write a blog post. At least once per year.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hell world.");
```
```rust
println!("Hell world.");
```
```dart
print('Hell world.');
```
```kotlin
println("Hell world.");
```

A blog post in 2020: ✔️
